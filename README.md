The order of the notebooks is:
1. `scrape_usda.ipynb` (saves in `raw_data/`)
2. `join_raw_data.ipynb` (saves in `concat_data/`)
3. `test_script.py` (saves in `json_data/` for now, but will be changed to save to Firestore. Parts of the other notebooks will be added into this one to make it one big script.
